Project for norming experimental stimuli relative to RNN models. Specifically, outputting 
surprisal metrics, frequency info, and checking if experimental vocabulary are contained 
in the models. 

### Dependencies
Requires the following python packages (available through pip):
* [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) v1.0.0

### Quick Usage
